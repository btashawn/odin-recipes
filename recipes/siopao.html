<h2> Siopao is a Filipino yeasted dough filled with various fillings. This dish was originally introduced by Hokkien, a Han Chinese subculture, immigrants. It has evolved with traditional Phillipine ingredients and is different from traditional bao as it is bigger in size and eaten more like a handheld snack. The most commong fillings are pork adobo and bola-bola, a meatball that is a combination of pork, chicken, beef, shrimp or salted duck egg. </h2>
